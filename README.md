ACM at UCR's Forge Robitics team is developing a robotics project based around Wizard Chess, a form of chess originally invented by J.K. Rowling in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The characters give verbal commands to the chess pieces and they move by magic. Seems impossible right? Not anymore! Using an Arduino Uno, along with an XY plotter, Wizard Chess can be recreated in real life! You can now play a full game of chess using voice commands and the chess pieces will automatically react accordingly.
